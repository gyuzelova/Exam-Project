                <h2>Are you know that . . .</h2>
                <h3>1. Fish are social and cooperative</h3>
                <p>Giant moray eels and Red Sea coral groupers often
                    hunt together. First, the groupers make gestures
                    to ask the eels to join them on a hunt — a kind
                    of fish sign language. Then, once out hunting,
                    they adopt complementary roles: the eels can
                    squeeze into crevices too small for the groupers,
                    while the groupers are faster swimmers in open
                    water. Working together, the pair has a better
                    chance of catching something to eat.</p>

                <h3>2. Fish feel pleasure, not just pain</h3>
                <p>Fish interact and form relationships with each other and other
                    fish species. For example, bluestreak cleaner wrasses provide a
                    special service to fellow fish. The wrasses swim into the gills
                    and mouths of their “clients” to remove and feed on their
                    parasites.</p>

                <h3>3. Fish have great memories</h3>
                <p>Contrary to popular belief, fish do have great memories.
                    Some species of fish can recognize and remember humans that give
                    them food rewards. Cleaner fish, as described above, can recognize
                    their clients that they regularly clean, which can be up to 100
                    different fish.</p>

                <h3>4. Fish are smart and can learn</h3>
                <p>Fish will avoid situations they know to cause them pain, and will seek out experiences with rewards.
                    Fish can also learn how to use tools. Many fish, for example, use rocks to crack open bivalves such
                    as clams, oysters and mussels for food.</p>

                <h3>5. Fish are flexible</h3>
                <p>Salmon and sea trout live in both saltwater and freshwater. These fish hatch in freshwater, and then
                    swim to the sea where they mature into adults. They undergo significant body changes and have
                    specialized organs to adapt to and excel in both freshwater and saltwater</p>

                <!-- <h3>6. Fish are excellent communicators</h3>
                <p>Even though fish do not have vocal chords, they still excel at communicating with one another. They
                    accomplish this through various sounds, scents, electrical pulses and motions.</p> -->
<!-- 
                <h3>7. Fish can migrate extremely far distances</h3>
                <p>Adult salmon living in saltwater environments migrate a vast distance to return to freshwater to
                    spawn. Salmon can travel up to 50 km per day on their spawning journeys, which is equivalent to us
                    running more than a marathon every day. In total, their migration can reach upwards of 3,000 km from
                    the ocean upstream through freshwater where they will spawn.</p>

                <h3>8. Fish have exceptional sensory capabilities</h3>
                <p>Fish can detect movement in the water through a special row of sensory scales along their body called
                    the lateral line. These sensory scales pick up low frequency sound waves that vibrate through the
                    water.</p>

                <h3>9. Fish can change colour</h3>
                <p>Fish are also known to change colours depending on camouflage needs, environmental conditions and
                    time of the year. Colours range all across the rainbow, from blues and greens to pinks and reds.</p> -->
